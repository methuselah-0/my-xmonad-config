ALOCK
=====

Alock is a simple screen lock application, which locks the X server until the
correct password is provided. If the authentication was successful, the X
server is unlocked and the user can continue to work. When 'alock' is started
it just waits for the first keypress. This first keypress is to indicate that
the user now wants to type in the password. Such a behavior might seem to be
annoying at the first glance, however this approach is chosen due to security
reasons.

Note, that this application does not provide any fancy animations like
[xlock](http://www.tux.org/~bagleyd/xlockmore.html) or
[xscreensaver](https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/) and probably never will. It
is just for locking current X session (with few flavors - see [usage](#usage)
section below). If this application is too much for you, you may give a try
[i3lock](http://i3wm.org/i3lock/).


Installation
------------

	$ autoreconf --install
	$ mkdir build && cd build
	$ ../configure --enable-pam --enable-hash --enable-xrender --enable-imlib2 \
	    --with-dunst --with-xbacklight
	$ make && make install

Integration with external applications (experimental features):

* --with-dunst - This option enables the integration with the
	[dunst](https://github.com/knopwob/dunst) (lightweight notification-daemon).
	When the screen is locked, the notifications are paused in order to prevent
	the leak of confidential data.
* --with-xbacklight - Enable display backlight dimming via the
	[xbacklight](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/app/xbacklight/). When the
	screen is locked, the backlight brightness is set to 0. The original
	(previous) value is restored whenever the screen is going to be unlocked
	(passphrase input). This feature has to be explicitly enabled via the
	`ALock.backlight: true` X Resource.


Usage
-----

The locking behavior can be customized with four 'alock' modules:
authentication (`-auth`), background (`-bg`), cursor (`-cursor`) and
input module (`-input`). In order to obtain the list of all available
modules (compiled in), issue the command as follows:

	$ alock --modules

When 'alock' is compiled with all modules, then running it without any
arguments is equivalent to:

	$ alock -auth pam -bg blank:color=black -cursor none \
	        -input frame:input=green,check=yellow,error=red

It is also possible to modify visual behavior of background, cursor and
input modules via the X Resources. All available resource names can be
found in the 'alock' manual file. The exemplary configuration might be as
follows:

	ALock*background*option:  center
	ALock*background*shade:   50
	ALock*cursor*name:        plus
	ALock*input.frame*input:  white
	ALock*input.frame*check:  blue
	ALock*backlight:          true


Available modules
-----------------

List of authentication modules:

* none - no authentication at all (not recommended)
* pam - authenticate using the 'pam-login' module
* passwd - authenticate using system password database
* hash - authenticate using arbitrary hash comparison

List of background modules:

* none - transparent background
* blank - fill the background with color
* shade - dim content of the screen
* image - use image as a background

List of cursor modules:

* none - no change to the current cursor
* blank - hide cursor pointer
* glyph - use compiled in glyph
* xcursor - use xcursor file
* image - use image

List of input modules:

* none - no input feedback for user
* frame - display frame on the current display
